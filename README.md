# Voice Agent Platform

![Voice Agent Platform Screenshot](/public/screenshot_platform.png)

A comprehensive voice agent platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and the OpenAI Realtime API. This project demonstrates advanced patterns for building production-ready voice agents with multi-agent orchestration, real-time audio streaming, and intelligent agent handoffs.

## Overview

I built this platform to explore and demonstrate sophisticated voice agent architectures. The system supports multiple agent patterns, real-time WebRTC audio streaming, and provides a flexible foundation for building custom voice agent applications.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Real-time Voice Interaction** - Low-latency voice conversations using WebRTC
- 🌊 **Live Voice Visualization** - Real-time audio waveform and frequency visualization
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Seamless handoffs between specialized agents
- 🛡️ **Output Guardrails** - Built-in content moderation and safety checks
- 🎛️ **Flexible Agent Patterns** - Multiple architectural patterns for different use cases
- 📊 **Comprehensive Logging** - Full event tracking and conversation history
- 🎚️ **Audio Controls** - Push-to-talk, codec selection, and audio recording
- 🛠️ **Visual Agent Builder** - Create and configure agents without writing code

## Voice Visualization

The platform features real-time audio visualization that provides visual feedback during voice conversations. The visualizer uses the Web Audio API to analyze microphone input and display dynamic waveforms and frequency data.

### Visualization Modes

- **Bars Mode** (Default) - Frequency spectrum displayed as animated bars with cyberpunk-themed gradients
- **Waveform Mode** - Time-domain audio waveform with volume-based intensity
- **Circular Mode** - Radial frequency visualization with pulsing center

The visualizer automatically activates when connected to a voice session and provides real-time feedback with smooth animations and glow effects that match the platform's modern UI design.

## Agent Builder

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one

2. **Enable Gmail API**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it

3. **Create OAuth2 Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/callback`
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your `.env` file

5. **Connect Gmail in the App**
   - Create an agent with Gmail tools (use "Add Capability" > "Gmail Integration")
   - A "Connect Gmail" button will appear in the Tools tab
   - Click to authorize access to your Gmail account

### Configuration

You can switch between different agent scenarios using the "Scenario" dropdown in the top right of the UI. Each scenario demonstrates different agent patterns and use cases.

## Agent Patterns

I've implemented two main architectural patterns, each suited for different scenarios:

### Pattern 1: Chat-Supervisor Architecture

This pattern uses a lightweight realtime agent for basic conversation and delegates complex tasks to a more powerful supervisor model. Perfect for scenarios where you want immediate responses but need high intelligence for complex operations.

**How it works:**
- A lightweight chat agent (`gpt-4o-realtime-mini`) handles greetings, basic conversation, and information collection
- Complex queries and tool calls are delegated to a supervisor agent (`gpt-4.1`)
- The chat agent provides immediate feedback while the supervisor processes the request

**Benefits:**
- Natural conversation flow with immediate responses
- High intelligence for complex tasks
- Cost-effective (uses cheaper realtime model for basic tasks)
- Easy migration path from existing text-based agents

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Why was my bill so high?"
Chat Agent: "Let me check that for you..."
  → Delegates to Supervisor Agent
  → Supervisor calls getUserAccountInfo tool
  → Supervisor formulates response
Chat Agent: "Your last bill was $150, mainly due to..."
```

**Implementation:** See `src/app/agentConfigs/chatSupervisor/`

### Pattern 2: Sequential Agent Handoffs

This pattern uses specialized agents that transfer users between them based on intent. Each agent is an expert in a specific domain, avoiding the performance degradation that comes from loading all instructions and tools into a single agent.

**How it works:**
- Multiple specialized agents, each with focused instructions and tools
- Agents can hand off to other agents via tool calls
- Handoffs are decided by the model based on user intent
- Each handoff updates the session with new instructions and tools

**Benefits:**
- Better performance (specialized agents vs. one-size-fits-all)
- Scalable architecture (add new agents without bloating existing ones)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Natural conversation flow

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I want to return my snowboard"
Authentication Agent → Authenticates user
  → Hands off to Returns Agent
Returns Agent → Processes return request
  → May escalate to Human Agent if needed
```

**Implementation:** See `src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail/` and `src/app/agentConfigs/simpleHandoff.ts`

## Agent Builder

The platform includes a visual Agent Builder that allows you to create and configure agents without writing code.

### Accessing the Builder

1. Click the **"Agent Builder"** button in the main app header
2. Or navigate directly to [http://localhost:3000/builder](http://localhost:3000/builder)

### Features

- **Visual Agent Configuration** - Configure agent name, voice, and instructions through a form interface
- **Tool Builder** - Define custom tools with parameters using a visual editor
- **Handoff Management** - Configure which agents can transfer to other agents
- **Preview & Export** - Preview agent configuration and export as JSON or TypeScript code
- **Local Storage** - Agents are saved to browser localStorage for persistence
- **Import/Export** - Import and export agent configurations as JSON files

### Building an Agent

1. **Basic Info**: Set the agent name, voice, and handoff description
2. **Instructions**: Write the agent's personality, behavior, and capabilities
3. **Tools**: Define functions the agent can call with their parameters
4. **Handoffs**: Select which other agents this agent can transfer to

### Templates

The builder includes quick-start templates for common agent types:
- Customer Support
- Sales Assistant
- General Helper

### Exporting Agents

The builder can export agents in two formats:
- **JSON**: For import into the builder or other tools
- **TypeScript**: Ready-to-use code for the `agentConfigs` folder

## Creating Custom Agents (Code)

### Basic Agent Structure

```typescript
import { RealtimeAgent, tool } from '@openai/agents/realtime';

export const myAgent = new RealtimeAgent({
  name: 'myAgent',
  voice: 'sage', // Voice selection
  instructions: `
    You are a helpful assistant that...
    [Your agent instructions here]
  `,
  tools: [
    tool({
      name: 'myTool',
      description: 'Tool description',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          param: { type: 'string', description: 'Parameter description' }
        },
        required: ['param']
      },
      execute: async (input) => {
        // Tool implementation
        return { result: 'success' };
      }
    })
  ],
  handoffs: [], // Other agents this agent can hand off to
});
```

### Adding a New Agent Scenario

1. Create your agent configuration file in `src/app/agentConfigs/`
2. Export your agent(s) as an array
3. Register it in `src/app/agentConfigs/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { myAgentScenario } from './myAgent';

export const allAgentSets: Record<string, RealtimeAgent[]> = {
  // ... existing agents
  myAgent: myAgentScenario,
};
```

4. The new scenario will appear in the UI dropdown automatically

### Agent Handoffs

To enable handoffs between agents:

```typescript
export const agentA = new RealtimeAgent({
  name: 'agentA',
  handoffDescription: 'Handles X tasks',
  handoffs: [agentB, agentC], // Can hand off to these agents
  // ...
});

export const agentB = new RealtimeAgent({
  name: 'agentB',
  handoffDescription: 'Handles Y tasks',
  handoffs: [agentA], // Can hand off back to agentA
  // ...
});
```

Agents decide when to hand off based on user intent and their instructions.

## Output Guardrails

The platform includes built-in output guardrails for content moderation. Guardrails check assistant responses before they're displayed to users.

**How it works:**
- When a response starts streaming, it's marked as `IN_PROGRESS`
- Guardrails check the content
- Response is marked as `PASS` or `FAIL` based on safety checks
- Failed responses are blocked from display

**Customization:** See `src/app/agentConfigs/guardrails.ts` and the guardrail logic in `src/app/App.tsx`

## Customization Guide

### Modifying Agent Instructions

Edit the `instructions` field in your agent configuration. For voice agents, keep instructions concise and avoid long lists.

### Adding Tools

Use the `tool()` function from `@openai/agents/realtime`:

```typescript
tool({
  name: 'myTool',
  description: 'Clear description of what the tool does',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      // Define parameters
    },
    required: ['param1', 'param2']
  },
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Your tool logic
    return { result: 'data' };
  }
})
```

### State Machines

For complex flows (like authentication), you can prompt agents to follow state machines. See `src/app/agentConfigs/customerServiceRetail/authentication.ts` for an example.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
- Verify network connectivity

### Audio Issues
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Try different codecs if audio quality is poor
- Ensure audio playback is enabled in controls

### Agent Not Responding
- Check the event log for errors
- Verify agent instructions are valid
- Check tool implementations for errors
